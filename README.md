# Ventilator-Prototype
This is an effort to create a make shift device to bridge patients infected with COVID-19 who need mechanical ventilation only when there is no ventilator available

I am an anesthesiologist with no real technical background.
Basically, this is a simple prototype that is easily reproducible and costs about $50. It can be made very quickly and does not require any technical expertise.
I started working on this last week, when I heard about the total number of ventilators in my state and the number that we think we're going to need. In the back of my mind, I kept telling myself that we can just use a bag and ventilate the patients with hand, but we are going to have a drastic shortage of man power too. So I decided to make a system that would replace hand ventilation and is cheap, easy and NEVER TO BE USED ON A PATIENT unless shortage of ventilators mean my patient with a reversible respiratory failure is going to die. That is the only time that I would use a system like this. 
Once I fix my 3D printer's bed, I will post the more elegant prototype. 
Here I'm using and arduino with DRV 8825 driver for a NEMA 17 stepper motor. 
I'm working on a few other prototypes too and once I can do more testing, I will post the STL files, arduino sketch and the part list.
Again, this is not a ventilator replacement; this is only to be used when patients have no other options and will simply die without a ventilator.
